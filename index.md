### CPSC 120

* Lab 2

  Lab 2 was the beginning to our course where we did a Fahrenheit to celsius, quadratic formula, and a hello world lab. This where we did the basics of just copy, pasting, and correcting using the style guide and the checking tool. I was fun but I was surprised that my partner and I took the whole period to complete this lab.
 
* lab 5
 
  Lab 5 part 1 was our first time using strings and vectors in part-1 where we made the code that sends out a response after listing 3 responses that the line of code has requested. This took so long that we weren't able to do part-2 & 3 (or we might have just forgotten) and needed to move on.

* lab 8

  Other than the odd spelling of "removed" in the comments part-2 was rather challeneging for me needing to use outside sources over the notes and slides we already have. This also was the first time for me to use the tutoring sessions and study groups.
